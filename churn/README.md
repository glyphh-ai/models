# Customer Churn Predictor

Encodes customer usage metrics into HDC vectors to identify churn risk patterns via similarity matching. Supports natural language queries with domain synonym expansion, morphological normalization, and two-stage exemplar-to-customer matching.

Built on [**Glyphh Ada 1.1**](https://www.glyphh.ai/products/runtime) · **[Docs →](https://glyphh.ai/docs)** · **[Glyphh Hub →](https://glyphh.ai/hub)**

## Getting Started

### 1. Install the Glyphh CLI

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Glyphh (includes runtime)
pip install glyphh
```

### 2. Install the model

```bash
# Start the Glyphh shell (prompts login on first run)
glyphh

# Inside the shell:
# glyphh> hub install model-churn
```

### 3. Query the model

```bash
# Inside the shell:
# glyphh> chat "what customers are likely to churn?"
# glyphh> chat "show me accounts with no logins"

# Interactive REPL
# glyphh> chat
```

## How It Works

You load your customer data daily (e.g. 100k accounts). Each customer is encoded as a glyph keyed by `customer_id` with an auto-generated timestamp. The model compares each customer's metrics against known churn patterns to surface risk levels, drivers, and recommended actions.

**Two-stage query pipeline:**

```
NL query ("what customers are likely to churn?")
  ↓
intent.py → keyword extraction + domain synonym expansion
  ↓
HDC encode → similarity search against exemplars (semantic layer)
  ↓
Gap analysis + confidence threshold → DONE or ASK
  ↓
If DONE: Stage 2 GQL → find customers matching the exemplar's metrics
  ↓
FactTree response: matched exemplar context + customer data results
```

The exemplars in `data/exemplars.jsonl` define what churn looks like — they're the model's domain expertise. Your customer data is the live input. The HDC similarity engine connects the two.

**Two-tier data model:**
- `data/exemplars.jsonl` — the model's *domain expertise*. Included in the .glyphh package on deploy. Defines what different risk profiles look like in the HDC similarity space.
- Customer records — *runtime data*. Ingested via the listener API. Real (or demo) customer accounts that queries match against.

## NL Query Pipeline

**intent.py** handles domain-specific query preprocessing:

- **Keyword extraction** — filters stop words, extracts content tokens
- **Domain synonym expansion** — maps broad terms to exemplar vocabulary:
  - "churn" → churn, at risk, inactive, declining, cancel, disengaged
  - "healthy" → healthy, safe, retained, growing, engaged
  - "frustrated" → frustrated, at risk, churn, support, tickets

**SDK-level morphological normalization** (automatic, no model code needed):
- Plurals: "days" → "day", "customers" → "customer", "tickets" → "ticket"
- Past tense: "walked" → "walk", "checked" → "check"
- Gerunds: "running" → "run", "building" → "build"

**Confidence gates** (configured in `config.yaml`):
- `similarity.threshold: 0.45` — below this, return ASK instead of DONE
- `disambiguation.min_gap: 0.015` — if top scores cluster, return ASK for disambiguation

**Two-stage execution:**
When an exemplar matches confidently, the runtime executes a Stage 2 GQL query to find customer records with similar metric profiles:
```yaml
gql_query_default: 'FIND SIMILAR TO glyph("{matched_id}") AT LAYER metrics LIMIT 10 THRESHOLD 0.5'
```

## Encoded Roles

**Semantic layer** (0.3 weight) — text matching for NL queries:

| Role | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| customer_id | text (key_part) | Stable customer identifier for temporal tracking |
| description | bag_of_words | Behavioral description text |
| keywords | bag_of_words | Extracted content keywords |

**Metrics layer** (0.7 weight) — numeric matching for customer data:

| Role | Type | Range | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| logins | numeric (thermometer) | 0–200, bin_width=5 | Login frequency |
| support_cases | numeric (thermometer) | 0–20, bin_width=1 | Support ticket volume |
| defects | numeric (thermometer) | 0–15, bin_width=1 | Bug encounters |
| feature_adoption | numeric (thermometer) | 0–100%, bin_width=5 | Feature utilization |

**Metadata** (returned after matching, never encoded):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| risk_level | high/medium/low — derived from matched exemplar |
| churn_driver | Root cause of churn risk |
| recommended_action | Suggested intervention |

## Temporal Behavior

Each daily load creates a new temporal snapshot per customer:
- `customer_id` (key_part) + auto timestamp = unique glyph identity
- Enables TREND, PREDICT, and DRIFT queries across time
- Same customer on Monday vs Tuesday = two distinct glyphs with linked history

## Testing

Run the test suite before deploying:

```bash
# Inside the glyphh shell:
# glyphh> model test .
# glyphh> model test . -v
# glyphh> model test . -k similarity

# Or directly
cd churn/
python tests.py
```

The test suite includes:
- **test_encoding.py** — config validation, layer structure, role encoding
- **test_metrics.py** — numeric binning edge cases, boundary values
- **test_similarity.py** — risk ranking correctness (high-risk ↔ high-risk)
- **test_temporal.py** — temporal snapshot and key_part behavior
- **test_queries.py** — NL query keyword extraction and attribute inference
- **test_nl_queries.py** — end-to-end NL→exemplar matching (churn queries → high risk, healthy queries → low risk)

## Data Format

Exemplars in `data/exemplars.jsonl` define what churn looks like:

```json
{
  "question": "customer with zero logins last 30 days",
  "risk_level": "high",
  "churn_driver": "low_usage",
  "usage_band": "inactive",
  "logins": 0,
  "support_cases": 0,
  "defects": 0,
  "feature_adoption": 15,
  "keywords": ["inactive", "no logins", "zero activity", "churn", "at risk", "disengaged"],
  "response": "High churn risk — customer has gone completely inactive.",
  "recommended_action": "Send re-engagement email sequence and schedule CSM outreach within 48 hours."
}
```

Customer data uploaded via the listener is raw metrics only — no risk labels, no pre-computed drivers:

```json
{
  "customer_id": "acme-corp",
  "concept_text": "acme-corp — 0 logins, 0 support cases, 15% adoption",
  "logins": 0,
  "support_cases": 0,
  "defects": 0,
  "feature_adoption": 15
}
```

The model infers risk, churn driver, and recommended actions by comparing raw customer metrics against the exemplars via similarity search.

## Architecture — Agent + Model Closed Loop

The churn model is an **observation and retrieval layer** — it encodes customer metrics and lets you search/compare risk patterns. It never creates, sends, or modifies customer records. Your LLM agent handles actions; the model handles memory and analytics.

```

**The closed loop:**
1. Agent queries the model → "which customers need attention?"
2. Model returns ranked accounts with risk scores and churn drivers
3. Agent acts on the insight → sends re-engagement email, escalates to CSM, adjusts renewal terms
4. Customer events fire (logins change, support tickets open, feature usage shifts)
5. Data pipeline captures events → normalizes → POSTs to listener
6. Model updates customer glyph metrics (new temporal snapshot)
7. Agent queries again → loop continues

## MCP Integration

LLM agents query the model via the runtime's MCP tools:

```python
# Available MCP tools:
# 1. nl_query — Natural language search
# 2. gql_query — Structured GQL search

# Example: Agent asks which customers are at risk
POST /{org_id}/churn/mcp
{
    "tool": "nl_query",
    "arguments": {
        "query": "customers with declining usage likely to churn"
    }
}

# Response:
{
    "content": [...],
    "result": {
        "matches": [
            {"customer_id": "acme-corp", "score": 0.87, "risk_level": "high"},
            {"customer_id": "beta-inc", "score": 0.72, "risk_level": "medium"}
        ]
    },
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "query_time_ms": 4.1
}
```

## Running the Demo

Customer records are ingested separately via the listener API — the same path real customer data would take.

```bash
# 1. Start the Glyphh shell (prompts login on first run)
glyphh

# 2. Seed 25 demo customers (from a separate terminal)
python seed_demo.py

# 3. Chat (back in the glyphh shell)
# glyphh> chat
```

### Demo queries to try

```
what customers are likely to churn in the next 30 days?
show me accounts with no logins
who has excessive support tickets?
which customers have low feature adoption?
find accounts approaching renewal that are at risk
show me healthy growing accounts
customers with defect frustration
who is completely inactive?
find accounts with billing issues
which customers should I prioritize this week?
```

### Loading real customer data

POST records to the listener API. Send raw metrics only — the model infers risk level, churn driver, and recommended actions by matching against the exemplars in `data/exemplars.jsonl`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/<org-id>/churn/listener \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "records": [
      {
        "customer_id": "acme-corp",
        "concept_text": "acme-corp — 0 logins, 0 support cases, 15% adoption",
        "logins": 0,
        "support_cases": 0,
        "defects": 0,
        "feature_adoption": 15
      }
    ]
  }'
```

`concept_text` is the display label shown in search results. The model determines risk, driver, and recommendations from the metrics alone.

## Query Examples

```bash
# Inside the glyphh shell:
# glyphh> query "customers who stopped logging in"
# glyphh> query "accounts with excessive support tickets"
# glyphh> query "what is acme-corp's churn risk?"
```
