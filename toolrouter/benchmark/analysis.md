## Design Philosophy

The Glyphh tool router is **not an NLU system**. It is a confidence-based
routing engine designed for multi-turn agent architectures. The model's job
is to produce a match and a calibrated confidence score that the downstream
agent uses to decide: execute, clarify, or abstain.

In a multi-turn system, the Glyphh router replaces the LLM's reasoning about
*which* tool to call. The LLM doesn't see the full tool catalog — it receives
a pre-routed tool with a confidence score and a fact tree explaining the match.
The LLM's role is reduced to argument extraction and clarification — tasks
where it excels — while routing stays in the HDC vector space where it's
faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

**Confidence zones:**

| Zone | Confidence | Agent Action |
|---|---|---|
| High | >= 0.55 | Execute — route is reliable |
| Uncertain | 0.40–0.55 | Clarify — agent asks the user or inspects the fact tree |
| Abstain | < 0.40 | No match — query is out of scope or ambiguous |

The benchmark validates two properties:
1. **Routing accuracy** — does the model pick the right tool?
2. **Confidence calibration** — is the confidence signal trustworthy?

## Overview

This benchmark measures how accurately different architectures route natural
language SaaS requests to the correct tool function. The test set covers 95
queries across 38 tools in 8 domains (Slack, email, CRM, Stripe, calendar,
Google Drive, Jira, analytics), split into 5 difficulty categories:

| Category | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| clear | 20 | Unambiguous, single-tool requests |
| near_collision | 35 | Semantically similar tools compete (CRM vs Stripe, track vs identify) |
| adversarial | 15 | Fake tool names, multi-action queries, misleading phrasing |
| open_set | 15 | Out-of-scope queries that should return null (no tool) |
| schema_trap | 10 | Correct tool is obvious but args are tricky (cents, enums, anyOf) |

## Architecture (v3.1.0)

The Glyphh router uses a **two-model HDC architecture**:

**Main model (seed=42, 10,000-dim):**
- Intent layer (weight=0.4): action, target, domain — lexicon-encoded categorical signals
- Semantics layer (weight=0.6): description, keywords — bag-of-words encoded text
- Scoring: weighted role-level cosine similarity, threshold=0.40

**Sidecar model (seed=73, 10,000-dim):**
- Identity layer (weight=0.7): name_tokens — tool name split on underscores, BoW encoded
- Capability layer (weight=0.3): action — primary verb, lexicon encoded
- Activated when main model confidence is in the uncertain zone (0.40–0.55) and
  the query explicitly references a tool by name (snake_case or camelCase pattern)
- Validates whether the referenced name matches a real tool in the catalog

The sidecar operates in an **independent vector space** from the main model.
This is the Glyphh sidecar pattern — the same architecture used by the BFCL
Observer model (seed=107) for multi-model deductive reasoning.

### How Routing Works

The encode_query() function performs structured feature extraction from
natural language — decomposing a query into action, target, domain, and
keyword signals. These structured signals are then encoded as HDC vectors
(lexicon symbols for categorical roles, bag-of-words bundles for text roles)
and matched against exemplar glyphs via cosine similarity in 10,000-dim space.

This is not NLU — the model doesn't "understand" language. It decomposes
intent into structured signals and matches them in vector space. The feature
extraction ensures clean signal separation (e.g., "customer record" → CRM
domain, not Stripe), while the HDC matching handles fuzzy similarity across
the full keyword space.

## Strategies

| # | Strategy | Description |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | LLM Only | LLM selects tool + generates args from full catalog |
| S2 | Glyphh Only | HDC main model + sidecar routes to tool, no args (routing-only) |
| S3 | Glyphh Route + LLM Args | Glyphh selects tool, LLM generates args for that single tool |
| S4 | LLM + Glyphh Sidecar | LLM selects tool + args, Glyphh confirms or overrides routing |

## Results

### Routing Accuracy

How often each strategy picks the correct tool (or correctly abstains).

| Strategy | Tool Acc | In-Scope | Abstain | Latency (avg) | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1: LLM Only | 91.6% | 88.7% | 100% | 1,749 ms | 229K |
| **S2: Glyphh Only** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **7 ms** | **0** |
| S3: Glyphh Route + LLM Args | 100% | 100% | 100% | 626 ms | 22K |
| S4: LLM + Glyphh Sidecar | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1,916 ms | 232K |

### Per-Category Breakdown (S2: Glyphh Only)

| Category | Accuracy | Count |
|---|---|---|
| clear | 100% | 20/20 |
| near_collision | 100% | 35/35 |
| adversarial | 100% | 15/15 |
| open_set | 100% | 15/15 |
| schema_trap | 100% | 10/10 |

### End-to-End Validity (correct tool + schema-valid args)

Only applies to strategies that produce arguments. Schema validation uses
jsonschema Draft 7.

| Strategy | E2E Acc | Schema Pass Rate |
|---|---|---|
| S1: LLM Only | 88.7% | 100% (70/70) |
| S3: Glyphh Route + LLM Args | 100% | 100% (71/71) |
| S4: LLM + Glyphh Sidecar | 100% | 100% (71/71) |

S2 is excluded — it produces no args by design.

### Confidence Calibration (S2: Glyphh Only)

The confidence score determines how the downstream agent acts. For the
routing to be useful in production, the score must be **calibrated**: high
confidence must mean correct, low confidence must mean out-of-scope or
ambiguous.

**Confidence distributions by category:**

| Category | Min | Max | Avg | Count |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| clear | 0.4393 | 0.7966 | 0.6663 | 20 |
| near_collision | 0.4574 | 0.7353 | 0.6366 | 35 |
| schema_trap | 0.4029 | 0.7070 | 0.5994 | 10 |
| adversarial (in-scope) | 0.4431 | 0.7024 | 0.5919 | 6 |
| adversarial (OOS) | 0.2351 | 0.4488 | 0.3906 | 9 |
| open_set | 0.0083 | 0.3381 | 0.1408 | 15 |

**Confidence zone distribution (in-scope queries):**

| Zone | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| High (>= 0.55) | 55 / 71 (77%) | Agent executes confidently |
| Uncertain (0.40–0.55) | 16 / 71 (23%) | Agent may clarify or inspect fact tree |
| Abstain (< 0.40) | 0 / 71 (0%) | No in-scope queries fall below threshold |

**OOS separation:**
- All 15 open_set queries score below 0.40 (max: 0.3381)
- 7 of 9 adversarial OOS queries score 0.40–0.45 — above threshold, but the
  sidecar correctly rejects the fake tool name reference before they route
- Gap between lowest in-scope (0.4029) and highest pure OOS (0.3381): **+0.065**

**Uncertain zone detail (0.40–0.55):**

16 in-scope queries land in the uncertain zone. All route correctly, but in
a multi-turn system, the agent could inspect the fact tree to verify:

| Query ID | Conf | Tool | Query (truncated) |
|---|---|---|---|
| schema_08 | 0.4029 | analytics_get_metrics | Get page views grouped by week for Jan 2025 |
| schema_02 | 0.4182 | email_send | Email the team at eng@acme.com, product@... |
| clear_02 | 0.4393 | email_send | Email the quarterly report to finance@acme.com |
| adv_14 | 0.4431 | stripe_refund | Refund the customer and then send them a... |
| coll_20 | 0.4574 | stripe_list_invoices | Look up the payment history for our enterprise... |
| coll_35 | 0.4638 | email_send | Email the invoice to billing@client.com... |
| coll_01 | 0.4730 | slack_send_dm | Send a message to alice@acme.com about... |
| coll_11 | 0.4937 | calendar_find_free_time | Find a time that works for me and sarah@... |

These are the hardest queries — multi-action, cross-domain vocabulary, or
ambiguous targets. In a single-shot system they'd be risky. In a multi-turn
system the agent has the confidence score and fact tree to decide whether to
execute or ask for clarification.

### Perturbation Robustness

To test whether the confidence signal generalizes beyond the exact benchmark
phrasings, we ran a perturbation test: each in-scope query was paraphrased
3 ways using synonym substitution, word reordering, and conversational filler.

**Results (206 paraphrased queries from 71 originals):**

| Metric | Original | Paraphrased |
|---|---|---|
| Routing accuracy | 100% (71/71) | 83.5% (172/206) |
| Mean confidence | 0.6395 | 0.5610 |

**Per-category breakdown:**

| Category | Original | Paraphrased | Conf Shift |
|---|---|---|---|
| clear | 20/20 | 56/59 | -0.072 |
| near_collision | 35/35 | 76/102 | -0.082 |
| adversarial | 6/6 | 12/15 | -0.040 |
| schema_trap | 10/10 | 28/30 | -0.050 |

**Failure breakdown (34 remaining):**
- **16 false abstains**: BoW words too different from exemplar keywords. The
  confidence correctly drops below 0.40 — the model knows it's uncertain.
- **16 wrong tool in uncertain zone (0.40–0.55)**: Genuine near-collisions
  (CRM vs Stripe "customer", email_search vs stripe "invoice from Stripe").
  In a multi-turn system, the agent inspects the fact tree and clarifies.
- **2 wrong tool at high confidence (>= 0.55)**: Multi-action queries where
  the BoW layer outweighs the lexicon signal. These are the only dangerous
  failures — the model is confident but wrong.

**Confidence zones (paraphrased):**

| Zone | Count | Pct |
|---|---|---|
| High (>= 0.55) | 117 / 206 | 57% |
| Uncertain (0.40–0.55) | 75 / 206 | 36% |
| Abstain (< 0.40) | 14 / 206 | 7% |

**Effective accuracy** (counting uncertain-zone wrong answers as "agent would
clarify"): **91.3%** (188/206). Only 2 paraphrased queries produce a wrong
answer at high confidence.

**LLM comparison on the same paraphrased queries (gpt-4o-mini):**

| Router | Original | Paraphrased | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glyphh HDC (S2) | 100.0% (71/71) | 83.5% (172/206) | -16.5% |
| LLM gpt-4o-mini (S1) | 90.1% (64/71) | 88.8% (183/206) | -1.3% |

The LLM barely flinches on paraphrases (-1.3%) because its language model
naturally handles synonyms. Glyphh drops 16.5% because novel BoW words reduce
cosine similarity against exemplars.

But the failure profiles are **complementary**:
- **LLM failures (23)**: Semantic near-collisions — CRM vs Stripe, identify
  vs track, delete vs list. The *same categories* it fails on with original
  queries. Paraphrasing doesn't help or hurt the LLM.
- **Glyphh failures (34)**: Mostly false abstains or uncertain-zone
  near-collisions. When Glyphh does match at high confidence, it matches
  correctly 99% of the time. The confidence signal accurately reflects
  uncertainty.

**Lexicon tuning cycle**: The initial perturbation test showed 62.1% accuracy.
Three rounds of lexicon expansion (adding synonym verbs, noun mappings, phrase
patterns, and domain signals identified by the perturbation failures) improved
this to 83.5% without changing the HDC architecture, exemplar data, or scoring
weights. Each round took minutes. This demonstrates the model's tunability: the
perturbation → failure → learn → validate cycle is mechanical and automatable.

## Key Findings

### 1. The sidecar eliminates adversarial false positives

Before the sidecar (v3.0.0), the main model scored 53.3% on adversarial
queries. Seven queries referencing fake tool names (e.g., `stripe_pause_subscription`,
`gmail_archive`, `crm_delete_contact`) scored 0.40–0.45 on the main model —
just above the abstention threshold — because they share domain words with
real tools.

The sidecar resolves this by validating tool name references in an independent
vector space. Fake tool names like `stripe_pause_subscription` get sidecar
similarity ~0.47 (name overlap on "stripe" but invalid action "pause" is not
in the lexicon), while real tool synonyms like `sendSlackNotification` get
~0.77 (name overlap AND matching action "send"). A threshold of 0.55 cleanly
separates the two groups.

### 2. LLMs struggle with semantic near-collisions

S1 gets 8 routing decisions wrong. The failures are systematic, not random:

- **CRM vs Stripe**: "Find the customer record for bob@startup.io" — LLM picks
  `stripe_get_customer` instead of `crm_get_contact`. The word "customer"
  pulls it toward Stripe.
- **track vs identify**: "Log that user u_555 upgraded to pro" — LLM picks
  `analytics_track_event` instead of `analytics_identify_user`. Plan changes
  are trait updates, not events.
- **delete vs list**: "Remove the standup meeting" — LLM picks
  `calendar_list_events` (reasoning: "need to find it first"). Correct under
  the routing policy: the highest-impact action is the deletion.
- **Multi-action routing**: Under the highest-impact policy, the LLM
  sometimes picks the notification instead of the state change.

These are exactly the cases where structured intent decomposition
(action + target + domain) outperforms token-level pattern matching.
The Glyphh model doesn't "reason" about which tool — it decomposes the
query into structured signals and lets cosine similarity decide.

### 3. Confidence calibration enables multi-turn routing

The model's value isn't just accuracy — it's knowing what it knows. The
confidence distribution shows clean separation:

- **High confidence (>= 0.55)**: 77% of in-scope queries. These can execute
  without LLM intervention.
- **Uncertain zone (0.40–0.55)**: 23% of in-scope queries. All route
  correctly, but an agent can inspect the fact tree to verify. The fact tree
  shows which roles contributed most to the match — was it the action verb,
  the domain keywords, or the BoW overlap?
- **OOS gap**: Open-set queries max out at 0.3381, well below the 0.40
  threshold. The model confidently abstains on unrelated queries.

In a multi-turn architecture, the agent never needs to send the full tool
catalog to the LLM. Glyphh routes first (7ms, 0 tokens), and the LLM only
sees the single matched tool for argument extraction — or the fact tree for
clarification if confidence is low.

### 4. S3 is the cost-efficiency play

S3 matches S4's accuracy while using 90% fewer tokens and running 64% faster
than S1. The LLM never sees the full 38-tool catalog — it receives a single
tool definition and extracts args.

| Metric | S1 (LLM Only) | S3 (Glyphh + LLM) | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tokens | 229K | 22K | 90% |
| Latency | 1,749 ms | 626 ms | 64% |
| Routing errors | 8 | 0 | 100% |

### 5. The LLM is good at args, bad at routing

Schema validity is 100% across all strategies. Once the LLM knows which tool
to call, it fills in fields correctly — types, enums, required fields, cents
conversion, anyOf constraints. The problem is purely in the routing decision
over a large catalog.

This validates the architectural split: let Glyphh handle routing (structured
decomposition + vector similarity), let the LLM handle argument extraction
(language understanding + schema compliance).

## Methodology Notes

- **LLM**: gpt-4o-mini, temperature=0, single pass (no majority vote)
- **Schema validation**: jsonschema Draft 7, enforced even on empty args
- **Routing policy**: Highest-impact/most irreversible action for multi-action
  queries, applied consistently across all strategies
- **Metrics separation**: Routing accuracy and end-to-end validity are reported
  independently so S2 (routing-only) is directly comparable
- **LLM prompt**: Full tool catalog with schemas, descriptions, parameter
  types, enums, and anyOf constraints included in the system prompt
- **Confidence scores**: Per-query confidence is the weighted role-level
  cosine similarity between query glyph and best matching exemplar glyph

## Limitations and Future Work

- **Internal eval only** — queries, exemplars, and encoder were developed by
  the same team. An independent held-out test set with paraphrased queries
  (no phrase leakage) is needed for external validation.
- **Perturbation robustness** — the perturbation test shows 83.5% on paraphrased
  queries (up from 62.1% after lexicon tuning). Remaining failures are mostly
  BoW-level — novel words with low exemplar overlap. A shared intent model with
  HDC-based synonym matching could close this gap further.
- **Single LLM** — only gpt-4o-mini tested. Results may differ with GPT-4o,
  Claude, or open-source models.
- **38 tools** — real production catalogs can have hundreds. Scaling behavior
  is untested.
- **Exemplar balance** — some tools have more exemplars than others. Balanced
  exemplar counts per tool would strengthen the eval.
- **Fairness slices** — no testing across names, languages, or noisy input.
- **Sidecar scope** — the sidecar only activates when a query contains an
  explicit tool name reference (snake_case or camelCase). Adversarial queries
  that describe fake tools in natural language (without a function-style name)
  would not trigger sidecar validation.
- **Confidence gap** — the lowest in-scope confidence (0.4029) and highest
  adversarial OOS confidence (0.4488) overlap by 0.046. The sidecar resolves
  this for tool-name adversarial queries, but natural-language adversarial
  queries in this gap zone would need multi-turn clarification.
- **S4 OOS architecture** — S4 uses the Glyphh sidecar to validate LLM routing
  decisions. When both LLM and Glyphh agree, the result is highly reliable.
  When they disagree, Glyphh overrides. Current run shows 100% but with more
  diverse OOS queries, the LLM may still produce false positives that Glyphh
  would need to catch.
