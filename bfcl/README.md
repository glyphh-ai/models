# Glyphh Ada 1.1 — BFCL V4 Function Caller

A hybrid HDC + FC (Function Calling) model for the [Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) (BFCL V4).

Built on the [Glyphh](https://www.glyphh.ai) hyperdimensional computing runtime. Named after Ada Lovelace — the mother of computer programs before they were ever invented.

## What this is (and isn't)

This model uses **hyperdimensional computing (HDC)** for function routing and a **Claude LLM** for argument extraction. It is not a general-purpose LLM. It is a purpose-built system that combines deterministic vector math with targeted LLM calls to solve the function calling problem.

We are transparent about the approach:

- **HDC handles routing** — which function to call. This is deterministic, sub-millisecond, and uses zero LLM tokens at inference time for the routing decision itself.
- **Claude handles arguments** — what values to pass. The LLM sees only the matched function schema and the user query. It fills in parameters.
- **Exemplars are pre-built at build time** — we use Claude to generate natural language variations of each function's intent, encode them into HDC vectors, and search against them at runtime. This is the same paradigm inversion strategy described in the [Pipedream white paper](../pipedream/white-paper.md).
- **Intent extraction is hand-tuned per domain** — each API class has custom verb/target/keyword maps in `intent.py`. This is not a generic model; it is specifically engineered for the 9 API classes and 128 functions in the BFCL V4 multi-turn benchmark.
- **Irrelevance detection uses a dedicated HDC model** — a separate encoder (seed=53) with parameter-name alignment as primary signal, no LLM involved.
- **Memory (agentic) is pure HDC** — prerequisite conversations are encoded as Glyphs and retrieved via cosine similarity. No LLM.

The goal is to demonstrate that HDC can serve as a practical routing layer for function calling, complementing LLMs rather than replacing them. The LLM is used where it excels (creative argument extraction). HDC is used where it excels (fast, deterministic, structured matching).

## Results

We evaluate the same HDC routing pipeline with different LLMs for argument extraction. The HDC layer (routing, intent extraction, irrelevance detection, memory) is identical across all versions — only the argument extraction LLM changes.

All scores are gorilla-verified (state execution checker), not internal routing accuracy.

### Leaderboard position (Opus 4.5, current best)

As of 2026-03-11, Glyphh Ada 1.1 would rank **#1** on the BFCL V4 leaderboard.

| 5 | Gemini 3 Pro (Prompt) | 72.51% | $298.47 | 60.75% | 90.65% | 70.86% | 12.08s |
| 6 | GLM-4.6 (FC thinking) | 72.38% | $4.64 | 68.00% | 87.56% | 66.60% | 4.34s |
| 7 | Grok 4.1 Fast (FC) | 69.57% | $17.26 | 58.87% | 88.27% | 68.24% | 6.74s |
| 8 | Claude Haiku 4.5 (FC) | 68.70% | $14.23 | 53.62% | 86.50% | 68.96% | 1.68s |

**Where we lead:**
- **Overall**: 79.92% (Opus) — #1 on the board, 2.45 points ahead of Opus standalone (77.47%). 74.50% (Haiku) — #3.
- **Agentic**: 87.55% — best on the board. Strong memory (87.1%, best on board) + web search (88.0%).
- **Non-Live AST**: 90.56% — best on the board, ahead of Opus standalone (88.58%).
- **Hallucination detection**: 87.56% — top 3, ahead of Haiku standalone (85.11%).

**Where we trail:**
- **Multi-Turn**: 65.12% — improved +11.37 from Haiku but still below Opus standalone (68.38%) and GLM (68.00%). A ~16pt internal-vs-gorilla gap persists across both LLMs, suggesting structural execution state divergence rather than model quality.
- **Latency**: 13.16s mean — slower than pure LLM approaches due to multi-stage pipeline.

**The architecture insight**: HDC routing + Opus arg extraction achieves #1 overall. The same HDC layer with Haiku ($18.64) scores 74.50% — still #3 on the board. Swapping only the LLM (no HDC changes) added +5.42 points, confirming that HDC routing and LLM arg extraction are independently tunable. Our agentic score (87.55%) beats every model on the board, including Opus standalone (79.13%), because HDC memory retrieval is deterministic and token-free.

### Pure HDC routing accuracy

Routing-only scores — did HDC pick the right function? This is constant across LLM versions since HDC routing is deterministic.

| Category | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| Non-Live | 97.5% |
| Hallucination | 99.9% |
| Live | 71.8% |
| Multi-Turn | 97.0% |
| Agentic (Memory) | 91.6% |
| **Overall** | **92.7%** |

The gap between routing accuracy (92.7%) and gorilla-verified scores (74.50%) reflects the difference between "did we pick the right function?" and "did the full pipeline — routing, argument extraction, state management, multi-step execution — produce the correct final state?" Routing is necessary but not sufficient.

## Architecture

### The paradigm inversion

The core insight is borrowed from our [Pipedream model](../pipedream/): move the LLM's work from runtime to build time.

Traditional function calling asks the LLM to route, select, and extract — all at runtime, under latency pressure, with non-deterministic results. We split the problem:

```
Build time:   LLM generates intent exemplars for each function. Once.
              Exemplars encoded into HDC vector space. Static index.

Runtime:      Query -> intent extraction -> HDC cosine search -> top match(es)
              Top match + query -> LLM arg extraction -> function call
```

The LLM's generative capability is used exactly where it's strongest: creative enumeration of how humans phrase intents (build time) and flexible parameter extraction from natural language (runtime). The structured matching problem — which of 128 functions does this query map to? — is handled by deterministic vector math.

### Three-stage pipeline

#### Stage 1: Intent extraction (`intent.py`)

Hand-built per-domain extraction with ~800 lines of verb/target/keyword maps:

- **55+ action verbs** mapped to canonical forms (e.g., "remove", "delete", "erase" -> `delete`)
- **140+ target nouns** across 9 domains (filesystem, social, math, trading, travel, vehicle, messaging, ticket, posting)
- **Per-class keyword detection** for API class routing in multi-turn scenarios
- **Pack phrase matching** from Glyphh SDK intent packs for multi-word patterns

This is explicitly hand-tuned for the BFCL function vocabulary. It is not a generic intent extractor. Each API class has patterns that distinguish its functions from others — e.g., "search in file" routes differently than "search for flights."

#### Stage 2: HDC encoding and scoring (`encoder.py`, `scorer.py`)

Two-layer encoder (dimension=10,000, seed=42):

**Layer 1 — Signature (weight 0.55):**
- `action` role: lexicon-encoded verb (get, create, delete, search, etc.)
- `target` role: lexicon-encoded noun (file, stock, flight, message, etc.)
- `function_name` role: bag-of-words on the method name tokens

**Layer 2 — Semantics (weight 0.45):**
- `description` role: bag-of-words on function description text
- `parameters` role: bag-of-words on parameter names, types, and enum values

At query time, the same encoder produces a query vector. Cosine similarity against all function vectors produces a ranked list. The top match is the routed function.

#### Stage 3: Argument extraction

- **Python functions**: Claude via native Anthropic `tool_use` — the LLM sees only the matched function schema and fills parameters naturally.
- **Java/JavaScript functions**: `LLMArgumentExtractor` with language-specific prompting for type conversion (Java `int` vs Python `int`, etc.).

The LLM used for this stage is the variable under test — see [Haiku 4.5 results](results/v1-haiku-4.5.md) and [Opus 4.5 results](results/v2-opus-4.5.md).

### Multi-turn architecture

Multi-turn entries require conversation state tracking across 3-5 turns, where each turn may involve multiple function calls.

```
Turn query -> extract_api_class() -> class keyword matching
           -> per-class BFCLModelScorer -> HDC function ranking
           -> filtered tools -> Claude multi-step loop
           -> execute calls -> feed results back -> next step
```

Key components:
- **MultiTurnHandler** (`multi_turn_handler.py`): Orchestrates HDC routing + CognitiveLoop state tracking
- **CognitiveLoop**: Tracks filesystem CWD, authentication state, prerequisite actions
- **DomainConfig** (`domain_config.py`): Per-class action->function mapping, multi-function detection keywords, exclusion rules for confusable pairs

The multi-step loop allows Claude to course-correct: it calls a function, sees the execution result, and decides whether to call another function or stop. This is critical for turns that require sequential operations (e.g., `cd` then `grep`).

### Irrelevance detection (`irrelevance_model.py`)

A dedicated HDC model (seed=53, separate from the main routing encoder) that determines whether a query is relevant to any available function. Three layers:

| Layer | Weight | Signal |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Parameter alignment | 0.50 | Do the query's nouns match any function parameter names? |
| Name alignment | 0.35 | Does the query reference words from the function name? |
| Description alignment | 0.15 | Does the query match function description keywords? |

Threshold: 0.20. If the best function score is below threshold, the query is classified as irrelevant (no function should be called). This is pure HDC — no LLM tokens consumed.

### Memory / agentic (`memory.py`)

Pure HDC retrieval. Prerequisite conversation sentences are encoded as Glyphs using bag-of-words. When a memory question arrives, it's encoded the same way and the top-k most similar sentences are retrieved via cosine similarity. The ground truth answer naturally appears as a substring in the retrieved text.

No LLM involved. 87.1% accuracy on gorilla-verified memory evaluation.

## Build pipeline

### Exemplar generation (`discover.py`)

At build time, we mine the BFCL dataset and generate exemplars for each function:

1. **Mining phase**: Extract real natural language queries from BFCL multi-turn ground truth data. Map each query to the function it invokes. Example: "search for Error in log.txt" -> `GorillaFileSystem.grep`

2. **Exemplar generation**: Create 3 weighted BoW (bag-of-words) variants per function:
   - **Variant 1**: Differentiating words (3x emphasized) + class name — highlights what makes this function unique vs. siblings
   - **Variant 2**: Name tokens + description + class name — broad semantic coverage
   - **Variant 3**: Mined query tokens + differentiating words — real human phrasings

3. **Output**: Per-class `exemplars.jsonl` and `tests.jsonl` files in `classes/{folder}/`

This diversity ensures HDC cosine search matches varied query phrasings. The same "send message" intent phrased as "post a note," "write a message," or "ping the channel" should all match the same function.

### Per-class structure

9 API classes, 128 total functions:

| Class | Functions | Domain |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| GorillaFileSystem | 17 | Filesystem operations (cd, ls, grep, mv, etc.) |
| TwitterAPI | 4 | Social media (tweet, retweet, follow, etc.) |
| MessageAPI | 8 | Messaging (send, receive, delete messages) |
| PostingAPI | 3 | Content posting |
| TicketAPI | 5 | Support tickets (create, resolve, close) |
| MathAPI | 14 | Mathematical operations |
| TradingBot | 13 | Stock trading (buy, sell, portfolio) |
| TravelBookingAPI | 28 | Travel (flights, hotels, car rentals) |
| VehicleControlAPI | 35 | Vehicle systems (engine, lights, HVAC) |

Each class has its own:
- `exemplars.jsonl` — pre-encoded HDC exemplars
- `tests.jsonl` — test queries for internal validation
- Intent patterns in `intent.py`
- Domain config in `domain_config.py`

## What we learned

### Routing accuracy != execution accuracy

Our pure HDC routing hits 92.7% internally — it picks the right function. But gorilla eval measures end-to-end state correctness after execution. The gap comes from:

- **Argument extraction errors**: HDC picks `grep(file_name=?, pattern=?)` correctly, but the LLM fills `pattern="error"` instead of `pattern="Error"` (case sensitivity).
- **Multi-step sequencing**: The ground truth expects `cd("docs")` then `grep("report.txt", "budget")`. Our model might grep first (wrong CWD -> wrong result).
- **State accumulation**: One wrong call in turn 1 cascades through turns 2-4.

### The empty turn problem

In v1, 55% of multi-turn failures were "empty turns" — Claude responded with text instead of making tool calls. The v2 auto-then-retry approach largely solved this: try `tool_choice=auto` first, fall back to `tool_choice=any` only when Claude returns no tool calls. This preserves natural behavior while preventing empty turns. Combined with holdout turn detection, tuned system prompts, and v3's prompt tightening to eliminate extra verification calls, multi-turn improved from 45% to 53.75% gorilla-verified on Haiku.

Switching to Opus 4.5 pushed multi-turn to 65.12% gorilla-verified (+11.37) — Opus produces fewer empty turns and handles multi-step sequencing more accurately. However, the ~16pt internal-vs-gorilla gap persists across both LLMs, suggesting it's structural rather than model-dependent.

### Hand-tuned intent extraction is a strength and a limitation

The 800-line `intent.py` with per-domain verb/target maps is what makes routing accurate for these specific 128 functions. But it doesn't generalize. A new API class would require new mappings. This is the tradeoff: domain-specific precision vs. generic coverage.

The Pipedream model takes the opposite approach — generic linguistic intent extraction that scales to 10,000+ actions. BFCL takes the targeted approach because the benchmark rewards precision on a fixed function set.

### LLM as a variable

By isolating the argument extraction LLM from the HDC routing layer, we can directly measure how much LLM quality affects end-to-end function calling accuracy. The HDC routing accuracy (92.7%) is constant — it's pure math. The delta between eval versions tells us exactly how much better reasoning translates to better execution.

See [Haiku 4.5 results](results/v1-haiku-4.5.md) and [Opus 4.5 results](results/v2-opus-4.5.md) for the comparison.
